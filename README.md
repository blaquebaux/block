# Blaque Baux Block

**A block of derivative strategies, bundled into one book.**

Block is a member of the Blaque Baux family. The [core repo](https://github.com/Carter-Warrens/blaquebaux)
is the **engine and blueprint** — a governed, systematic platform (Julia) with a venue-agnostic
execution controller and a Layer-3 live-money safety gate. Block points that engine in its own
direction and inherits the governance wholesale.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Carter-Warrens/blaquebaux-block.git
julia --project=engine -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'   # one-time engine setup
```

## The thesis

A meta-sleeve: a basket of derivative-based strategies (options overlays, futures/vol, structured payoffs) combined into one book and weighted by the engine's optimizer. It is the derivatives counterpart to how the spine blends sleeves — Brittle (short premium) and Bleed (long tails) are natural components, sized so the block is balanced rather than one-sided.

## Research plan (Path A — not yet built)

- Component strategies — covered/overlay, calendar/vol, defined-risk spreads (build on Brittle).
- Optimizer-weighted blend — use the engine's PortfolioOpt to combine the derivative sleeves.
- Balance convexity — pair Brittle-style short-premium with Bleed-style long tails.

Nothing above is implemented or validated. This is the map, not the territory.

## Status
**Scaffold.** Engine wired as a submodule; strategy research not yet conducted.

## The Blaque Baux family
Base: **Blaque Baux** (engine + spine). Sleeves: **Blunt** (short-horizon tactical) · **Boom** (mega-cap blue chips) · **Brash** (crypto/alternatives) · **Bleed** (tail-catcher) · **Bottom** (penny/micro-cap) · **Brittle** (near-expiry OTM options) · **Broad** (broad/thematic ETFs) · **Bore** (market-neutral) · **Bulk** (defense) · **Brown** (conservative sectors) · **Blue** (entertainment/green-energy/tech) · **Beyond** (short-horizon growth) · **Bubble** (the AI complex) · **Basel** (Basel-regulated banks) · **Bio** (biotech / idiosyncratic) · **Bounce** (range-bound 'kangaroo' market) · **EMEA** (Europe/Middle East/Africa) · **APAC** (Asia-Pacific) · **LATAM** (Latin America) · **BitDollar** (crypto / dollar axis) · **Blurred** (uncorrelated basket) · **Backsliders** (broken decliners (short)) · **Brute Force** (artificially propped-up) · **Block** *(this repo)*.

## Layout
```

research/   Path-A strategy sketches (to come)
live/       governed live drivers (once a sleeve graduates to paper A/B)
